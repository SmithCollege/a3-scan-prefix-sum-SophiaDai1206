Did your graph match your runtime analysis expectations?
I think so but because the runtime for each array size and for each algorithm is too small, it's quite hard to tell. 

What went well with this assignment?
I think the part of writing each prefix algorithm went well. 

What was difficult?
Since I allocate the array in shared memories but not global memories, I didn't realize that at first so when I was trying to run the array size larger than 1024,
it told me invalid configuration argument. It took me a while to figure that out and also the timer is quite weird, and I don't think those time are correct,
but I haven't figure out where's wrong. 

How would you approach differently?
Maybe ask for help on time instead of waiting all the time. 

Anything else you want me to know?
The timers are weird, so I don't know if I collected the right data.
